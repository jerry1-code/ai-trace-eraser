# KNOWN LIMITATIONS — ai-trace-eraser

Stated honestly so users and agents do not over-rely on the skill.

1. **No detector guarantee.** Internal risk estimates are heuristics; they do not predict or guarantee Turnitin, CNKI, GPTZero, Originality.ai, or any external result. Only a comparable external re-test is authoritative.

2. **External re-test required for completion.** Without comparable external scores, the skill can only produce candidate versions and internal diagnosis; it cannot mark a chapter Done.

3. **Strict targets may be unreachable.** Targets below ~15% may be unrealistic for some genres and standardized methodology language; integrity, protected content, readability, and meaning preservation override the numeric target.

4. **Quantitative thresholds are calibration anchors, not classifiers.** The signal table (CV, transition density, TTR, etc.) guides consistent scoring; it is not a trained detector and carries academic-register caveats.

5. **Chinese-route scoring is structural and heuristic.** It uses fixed evidence fields and shared-structure checks rather than the English D1–D15 model; cross-language comparability is limited.

6. **DOCX format preservation is environment-dependent.** Complex formatting, tracked changes, comments, equations, and reference-list layout may not be verifiable; the skill then delivers a labelled candidate or plain-text reconstruction.

7. **No third-party humanizers or bypass services.** The skill never routes text through external "undetectable AI"/paraphrasing APIs; this is a confidentiality and integrity boundary, not a feature gap to be worked around.

8. **Authorized text only.** The skill is for text the user owns, authored, co-authored, or is explicitly authorized to edit; it must not be used to misrepresent authorship or bypass institutional disclosure/assessment rules.

9. **Single-chapter closed loop.** By design it processes one chapter per round (two only on explicit request); whole-document handling requires multiple rounds and a comparable whole-document test.

10. **Not a plagiarism/similarity tool.** This skill only reduces AI-writing-risk patterns. It does not optimize plagiarism scores, Turnitin Similarity Index, or 查重. If the user needs similarity reduction, treat it as a separate task.
